%description
An implementation of Docker Compose Spec
(https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md)
with Podman backend.
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications
with Docker or Podman.
With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a
single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does
everything that needs to be done to get it running.
Using podman-compose you can migrate the docker-compose solution to kubernetes.
